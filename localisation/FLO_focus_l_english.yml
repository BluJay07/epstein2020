 FLO_useful_idiot:0 "The Useful Idiot"
 FLO_useful_idiot_desc:0 "Patrick Little... a failure, a hypocrite, and, beyond all else, a moron. However, he has pledged his unfaltering support for Barron's government, and will be a useful idiot to whip up populist support against those cliqueists in Miami."

 FLO_dirty_dirty_patrick:0 "Dirty, Dirty Patrick"
 FLO_dirty_dirty_patrick_desc:0 "Little is outraged at his removal, and is drumming up support for him. It's barely significant, but a threat to our rule is a threat to our rule.
