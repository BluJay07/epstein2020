 DESC_LEADER_VERMIN_SUPREME:0 "Vermin Supreme's story is an odd one, and one that nobody would have believed but half a year ago. After the Chaos Of The First Months, and the establishment of a Pro-Trump Libertarian authority in the Rust Belt, Supreme became the unlikely leader of those who were unhappy with playing Trump's trumpet.\n\nConspiring with AOC, and enlisting the support of 'Mad Dog' Mattis, Supreme led a coup against the Jorgenson Government and declared the American Free State. The Anti-Trump Triumvirate managed to capture the entire South-East Rust Belt from Jorgenson's grip before the Good Friday Ceasefire.\n\nNow, however, the Free State is in dire straits. The Triumvirate is collapsing. AOC sneers at Supreme's more libertarian ideals as she organises her Green Army, while Mattis becomes more and more disillusioned with civilian government by the day."
