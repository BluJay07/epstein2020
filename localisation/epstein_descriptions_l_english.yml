 DESC_LEADER_VERMIN_SUPREME:0 "Vermin Supreme's story is an odd one, and one that nobody would have believed but half a year ago. After the Chaos Of The First Months, and the establishment of a Pro-Trump Libertarian authority in the Rust Belt, Supreme became the unlikely leader of those who were unhappy with playing Trump's trumpet.\n\nConspiring with AOC, and enlisting the support of 'Mad Dog' Mattis, Supreme led a coup against the Jorgenson Government and declared the American Free State. The Anti-Trump Triumvirate managed to capture the entire South-East Rust Belt from Jorgenson's grip before the Good Friday Ceasefire.\n\nNow, however, the Free State is in dire straits. The Triumvirate is collapsing. AOC sneers at Supreme's more libertarian ideals as she organises her Green Army, while Mattis becomes more and more disillusioned with civilian government by the day."

 DESC_LEADER_JAMES_MASON:0 "James Mason once said, "The Nazis cannot take power as long as the existing U.S. government remains in place."  Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mason grew fantasized with far-right and Neo-Nazi movements from a young age.  At age 14, he joined George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party.  Following this, he left the American Nazi Party and joined the National Socialist White People's Party.  Due to crimes he committed in his adulthood (including pepper spraying a group of African-American teenagers), Mason was constantly in and out of jail.  Once released, he helped co-found the Atomwaffen Division in 2015.  Once the United States collapsed, he gathered his loyal forces and hosted a meeting in Denver to plan the basis of his new Amerikareich, a state built on racial purity and Spartanism who would prepare for the inevitable race war that would determine the future of the white race."
