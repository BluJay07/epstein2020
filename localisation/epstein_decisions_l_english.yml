Worse still, in order to strengthen their resistance, they have made a deal with the devil and allied with the Neo-Nazi organisation 'New Awakening'! This cannot stand!\n\nHowever, our forces are still organising from the Chaos Of The First Months, and public opinion is low enough as it is in the cities. §RWe do not have long to beat them until we will be forced to sign a peace!§!"
