MOL_birth_of_a_nation_desc:0 "Without a proper legal code, economy, or political system in place, we're at quite a fragile moment in our young nation's lifespan. The biggest concern comes from the nearby §Oarmy depot§!, but snakes hide around every corner. We could do this quickly, with the §Oarmy's§! help, and impose laws that will put us in a better place faster, or do it the proper way, with all the beaurocracy that comes with it."

MOL_this_takes_time:0 "This Takes Time"
MOL_this_takes_time_desc:0 "Rushing a nation's first steps could only end poorly. We've got to take things slowly and carefully. First, we deal with the economy, the rest will fall into place in time."
MOL_on_the_issue_of:0 "On the Issue Of..."
MOL_on_the_issue_of_desc:0 "Inaction is an admittedly attractive option here, but not one we can take. Something needs to happen before we and our people go out with little more than a whisper"
