 ins.1.d:0 "''Vas privetstvuyet Rossiyskaya Federatsiya.'' - Seems like the videoconference has started. \n\n ''The Russian Federation greets you, [ROOT.GetLeader], and of course [ROOT.GetName]. We already know why are you adressing us.'' - says Vladimir Putin's translator - ''The situation on the American continent is a mess, and to he honest, we have very little interest in helping you restore the order.'' \n\n ''Perhaps if you had proven to us you are the worthy ally. Russia always rewards loyal friends.'' - Putin smiled after that phrase was translated \n\n ''So first, we need to make sure there is going to be an understanding between our governments. We support governments that value the order, and discipline - and those that aim for the tradition. The question now is; do you think your state is going to be capable of cooperation with us?''"
 ins.1.a:0 "''We have a great government focused around the [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] values''"
 ins.1.b:0 "''Our government might be [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology], but I hope we will get along''"

 ins.2.d:0 "''Well, we are mostly delighted.'' - Putin smiles from the camera. \n\n ''. - ''Indeed, we can cooperate with [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] authorities. And that cooperation is going to be most likely fruitful. But that's just the beggining'' - Putin went silent for a minute after those words \n\n ''Pragmatism is a virtue. We do not expect anything breathtaking, but we surely do like to see what path of the development you've picked. Our generals may need to cooperate with yours, and thus we need to make sure you will cope with our methods and people.'' \n\n ''The only interest of aggressive forces of NATO is in pacifying you. We also can't hide ours - and ours is to spread the Russian influence over the American continent. For that, we will need to know what strategies your staff prefers, and for how long you're going to persist. We're honest, and we want a honest answer - what are your military capabilities?''"
 ins.2.a:0 "''[ROOT.GetName] is strong, and is on its way to reunite the USA!''"
 ins.2.b:0 "''Our strategy will adapt to yours, Mr. Vladimir''"

You are really an ally worthy consideration.'' - Putin smiles. \n\n ''. - ''I can already see there will be a good cooperation between our nations. Although, those that give should also receive. We do not ask for much, and at this point we will count on your courtesy.'' \n\n ''We are in need of your people, not normal people though - academics. The Federation would be happy to receive the brightest minds you can get in your state. We won't keep them for long, if you agree...'' \n\n ''...Friend.'' - finished Putin's translator"
 ins.3.a:0 "''May this be an act of our friendship. We accept your request.''"

 ins.4.d:0 "Putin rises from his chair smiling and then turns to whisper to the translator man. After a while, the result of our negotiations is known. \n\n ''Russian Federation is proud to announce that [ROOT.GetName] is a nation that will be given our full aid. We recognize you as a state that struggles to follow the Russian interests and policy, and thus shall rightfully restore the order on the American continent.'' \n\n''Your efforts are great and we have no doubts that our cooperation will prove to be more fruitful than we could've expected. We will stay in touch and watch you closely. Keep the firm hand over your people, [ROOT.GetLeader].''"
