 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_NAME:0 "Good Friday Armistice"
 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_DESC:0 "Civil War has broken out in the United States! After both Donald Trump and Joe Biden claimed victory in the 2020 Presidential Election, rival governments were formed which inevitably broke out into Civil War in January 2021. Seizing their best chance to reach power, various other groups also rose up throughout the nation.\nFollowing the Chaos of the First Three Months, a temporary ceasefire has finally been signed on Good Friday. But everyone knows it is not to last."
 #Florida
 FLO_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the Chaos of the First Months, Floridian Trumpists found themselves completely cut off from the rest of the Loyalists, thanks to the betrayal of Kanye and the Confederacy.\nEric Trump, who found himself trapped in the peninsular along with several others, was assigned as the Provisional leader of Florida by Donald. However, Just before the ceasefire was signed, Eric was assassinated by an assailant with unknown motivations. The military junta promptly put his younger brother, Barron, in charge, believing they could control him. They are wrong."
 #Texas
 TEX_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Don't mess with Texas! Following the outbreak of Civil War, Senator Ted Cruz was quick to mobilise and assert control over the country. Through the proclamation of neutrality, a move which has him acclaimed by some and demonised by others, Texas was largely spared the fires of war. National guard troops seized areas of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana to avoid any fighting from spilling into Texas proper, but the Lone Star State has been otherwise untouched.\n\nWith the ceasefire, it is beginning to set in that this war won't be over any time soon. Many clamour for political reform, and a proper Texan constitution."
 #Maine
 NEW_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the beginning of the Second American Civil War, many republican media elements fled to Northern Maine, mainly to distract Bidenist forces from focusing completely on Trump and to have an easy escape if the Bidenist forces actually came after them. After the Good Friday Ceasefire was signed however, Northern Maine was still under the control of the ragtag group of journalists, media moguls, Conservative talking heads, Conspiracy theorists, and many other misfits. \n\nWith war on the horizon, Maine stands on the brink of becoming a warzone."
 #Montana
 MON_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Announcing its provisional independence as the nation fell into chaos, the State of Montana was mostly unaware of the situation behind closed doors. No one could have ever expected the collapse of the United States, and while shell-shocked local authorities heard no ambiguous instructions from fighting rival governments, the last governor Stephen Bullock has enacted emergency powers and entrenched the rule of the Independent Provisional Democratic Party of Montana. While being prepared for the worst to come, Montana was never prepared to shape its own independent destiny, which lays down in its hands."
 #American Free State
 AFS_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the Chaos of the First Months, and the establishment of a Pro-Trump Libertarian authority in the Rust Belt; a faction led by Vermin Supreme, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and James Mattis broke away from Jo Jorgensen’s G.L.A.R., successfully leading a revolt and declaring the new ‘American Free State,’ capturing the entire South-East Rust Belt before the Good Friday Ceasefire.\nNow, however, the Free State is in dire straits. AOC sneers at Supreme's more libertarian ideals as she organizes her Green Army, while Mattis becomes more and more disillusioned with civilian government each day."
 #IDA
 IDA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "God Save President Trump! The Western Command Zone is a small exclave of Trumpist rule between the Autonomous State of Utah and the Rebellious State of Montana. While currently having minimal support due to the National Protection War, once the traitors in Indianapolis are dealt with it is likely that Trump will turn his eyes West and the Western Command Zone will become the next frontier of the Civil War."
 #HOP
 HOP_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "The Hopi Tribe is in dire straits. When the Navajo and the Tohono agreed to take provisional control of the former state of New Mexico as the White Man's Government dissolved and dissappaited to Civil War, the Hopi migrated North to avoid the encirclement and possible destruction by the Navajo, hoping to start their own venture. However, such a small tribe controlling such vast land has proven... troublesome. There are many concerns that outside powers may attack, and certain groups could easily take advantage of the Hopi's poor position...\n\nThe Hopi experiment is surely not to last."
 #CAS
 CAS_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Cascadia, Awake! When the vile communists in San Francisco decided they would betray the Legitimate President, we had finally had enough! Not just of them, but of America as a whole. Cascadia shall be free! We will fight for our independence, now and when the Civil War is over!\n\nHowever, it must be said, Cascadia is in a... troublesome position right now. In order to fully secure our independence, we have had to enlist the support of some rather unsavoury elements. We had to in order to survive! Hopefully they won't cause us any more trouble later down the line..."
 #MOL
 MOL_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Molossia is a bizarre nation. It was originally a 'Micronation'- it was practically a joke, a man and his family who dressed up in funny clothes and pretended to be their own country. But when the Civil War broke out, something bizarre happened. A Vacuum of authority, between Utah and the People's Republic, located almost exactly where this micronation stood. To survive, a council of Free Towns was forged between the settlements that stood here. Kevin Baugh, President of 'Molossia', took up the torch of this coalition, and turned Molossia into a real, breathing country, complete with its own economy and army!"
 #PAC
 PAC_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "For many within the army, siding with the West Coast Bidenists was... difficult. Many secretly still held loyalties to Trump, and many more still had become disillusioned with democracy completely. Regardless, they would side with the West Coast Bidenists. Until the People's Republic was declared. This abomination on American soil, this Bolshevik Chinese Puppet, was the straw that broke the camel's back. As the Pacific Fleet could no longer support this Communistic Construct, they declared full mutinity and seized Alaska and Hawaii. America may burn, but we'll be damned if it's some no good commies that are behind it!"
