 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_NAME:0 "Good Friday Armistice"
 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_DESC:0 "Civil War has broken out in the United States! After both Donald Trump and Joe Biden claimed victory in the 2020 Presidential Election, rival governments were formed which inevitably broke out into Civil War in January 2021. Seizing their best chance to reach power, various other groups also rose up throughout the nation.\nFollowing the Chaos of the First Three Months, a temporary ceasefire has finally been signed on Good Friday. But everyone knows it is not to last."
 #Florida
 FLO_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the Chaos of the First Months, Floridian Trumpists found themselves completely cut off from the rest of the Loyalists, thanks to the betrayal of Kanye and the Confederacy.\nEric Trump, who found himself trapped in the peninsular along with several others, was assigned as the Provisional leader of Florida by Donald. However, Just before the ceasefire was signed, Eric was assassinated by an assailant with unknown motivations. The military junta promptly put his younger brother, Barron, in charge, believing they could control him. They are wrong."
 #Texas
 TEX_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Don't mess with Texas! Following the outbreak of Civil War, Senator Ted Cruz was quick to mobilise and assert control over the country. Through the proclamation of neutrality, a move which has him acclaimed by some and demonised by others, Texas was largely spared the fires of war. National guard troops seized areas of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana to avoid any fighting from spilling into Texas proper, but the Lone Star State has been otherwise untouched.\n\nWith the ceasefire, it is beginning to set in that this war won't be over any time soon. Many clamour for political reform, and a proper Texan constitution."
 #Maine
 NEW_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the beginning of the Second American Civil War, many republican media elements fled to Northern Maine, mainly to distract Bidenist forces from focusing completely on Trump and to have an easy escape if the Bidenist forces actually came after them. After the Good Friday Ceasefire was signed however, Northern Maine was still under the control of the ragtag group of journalists, media moguls, Conservative talking heads, Conspiracy theorists, and many other misfits. \n\nWith war on the horizon, Maine stands on the brink of becoming a warzone."
 #Montana
 MON_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Announcing its provisional independence as the nation fell into chaos, the State of Montana was mostly unaware of the situation behind closed doors. No one could have ever expected the collapse of the United States, and while shell-shocked local authorities heard no ambiguous instructions from fighting rival governments, the last governor Stephen Bullock has enacted emergency powers and entrenched the rule of the Independent Provisional Democratic Party of Montana. While being prepared for the worst to come, Montana was never prepared to shape its own independent destiny, which lays down in its hands."
