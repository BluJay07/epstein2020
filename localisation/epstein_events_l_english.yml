 greatlake.1.t:0 "Challenges to the Jorgenson Government"
 greatlake.1.d:0 "Taking advantage of the temporary peace, many figures from across the Libertarian spectrum have travelled to the Great Lakes to directly challenge Jorgenson's leadership.\n\nNot exactly being prepared for a civil war herself when she took leadership of the Libertarian party, she's herself is open to resignation.\n\nThe main two candidates are Clint Eastwood, who wants to align far more closely with Donald Trump and implement policy akin to Reaganism, and the other is John McAfee who wants to establish what is effectively an Anarcho-Capitalist society with security forces exclusively for the purpose of protecting the region from invasion."
 greatlake.1.a:0 "Actually, I think I'll stick around..."
 greatlake.1.b:0 "Up the Yellow and Black!"
 greatlake.1.c:0 "For a fistfull of dollars..."
 greatlake.2.t:0 "The Great Lakes draws closer"
 greatlake.2.d:0 "Following our failure to secure much of Wisconsin and Michigan, and the seizure of those territories by the Libertarians, the Republican friendly Clint Eastwood has recently come to lead those territories. Incredibly Trump aligned, Clint is offering to fully pledge the Great Lakes behind the Trumpist cause in exchange for autonomy, at least for the duration of the Civil War."
 greatlake.2.a:0 "I loved his films!"
 greatlake.2.b:0 "We don't need some Reagan copy-cat."
 #Cascadia
 cascadia.1.t:0 "Coup!"
 cascadia.1.d:0 "The Worst has happened! Our former allies in New Awakening have infiltrated the Resistance Council far more than ever could have been expected, and they have now launched a coup to oust all non-aligned members of the council!\n\nWe had not expected this level of cohesion."
 cascadia.1.a:0 "We are powerless to stop them."
 cascadia.1.b:0 "Rally the resistance! We have a new foe!"
 #Tribal
 tribal.1.t:0 "Neo-Nazi gangs set off from Denver"
 tribal.1.d:0 "Many neo-nazi militias which had met in Denver, rallied by James Mason, set off to the South. We have no real idea what they're up to... but so far they've left us alone, and we have much bigger things to worry about."
 tribal.1.a:0 "I'm sure it'll be fine... what's the worst they could do?"
 tribal.2.t:0 "Invasion!"
 tribal.2.d:0 "It all began with rumors of Americans on the horizon. Some braves souls left their camps to meet them, seeking to redirect them, as they'd thought them to be lost refugees. They were mistaken. The Americans brandished flags branded with swastikas and donned the garb of guerilla fighters. Countless villages by the border have been brutalized and massacred, and it seems nothing truly halts them from marching on our capital."
 tribal.2.a:0 "The end of our dream."
 tribal.3.t:0 "The Death of James Mason"
 tribal.3.d:0 "The Great Fuhrer is dead! He has led us through many trials and tribulations, and has been a loyal National Socialist since he was but a child. We will never forget our first Fuhrer, and he will be remembered forever as the man who saved the world. However, his protege, Augustus Sol Invictus, now seizes the reins with little to no opposition. And his plans are far grander."
 tribal.3.a:0 "HAIL CAESAR!"
