 greatlake.1.d:0 "Taking advantage of the temporary peace, many figures from across the Libertarian spectrum have travelled to the Great Lakes to directly challenge Jorgenson's leadership.\n\nNot exactly being prepared for a civil war herself when she took leadership of the Libertarian party, she's herself is open to resignation.\n\nThe main two candidates are Clint Eastwood, who wants to align far more closely with Donald Trump and implement policy akin to Reaganism, and the other is John McAfee who wants to establish what is effectively an Anarcho-Capitalist society with security forces exclusively for the purpose of protecting the region from invasion."

As a city, Seattle has been in chaos ever since the beginning of the George Floyd protests, that was until they declared full support for the Sanderists cause and pledged to fight until the death for an America that was truly equal. The occupation of this city will be a pain in the ass for our government.

It was an unusually cold and quiet night in Seattle, perfect for an early night, cozy in the most luxurious linens and blankets the remaining coffers of Seattle could buy. \n\nA gunshot rang out through the night, practically shocking Raz awake, he thought it sounded unusually close, for the sole fact that the grounds of the Capital building were teeming with loyalist bodyguards. The gunshots did not stop however, but instead became more and more frequent, and as the blasts of rifles got closer and closer, Raz could see only one thing out the window of the Capital building..."

 California.2.t:0 "The Puppet Master Demands More Strings"
 California.2.d:0 "Bernie Sanders was forced to appear in front of the people who supported him, the office was in a darkened atmosphere as representatives of the Sanders administration approached their seats. At the head of the Chinese delegation, there was silence, eagerly waiting to hear the report from Sanders, previously asking him to fulfill the obligations he gave them, within which he had a set deadline to ensure Maoism had a place in the New America. Sanders knew that the Chinese would be angry with his moves to Democratize the country after all the support and U.N. Shit they went through to help him against the Fleet. When he told them his plans for Democratization, the room fell silent. Dissatisfied with the work that this administration was doing, very unsuccessfully, the delegate demanded something that both sides knew could never be fulfilled, impossible both during unity and during the rapid spreading of dissent. Sanders tried everything to make the Chinese delegation come to its senses, but they did not want to give up their idea and intention to repay all the debts invested in this Sanders project. The meeting lasted in full swing for the next hour, full of tensions over agreements, new promises, old lies, and nothing new except the look of eyes that were supposed to persuade the Chinese delegation to deviate from debt collection. Everything was in vain. In the end, the Chinese decided to slap the Sanders administration, knowing that they had no money to pay off the debts, saying the following: "For good intentions and good service to remain as it is now, we will have to approach the collection of your debts by different methods. We demand the following service from you - we want our government's full right and complete control over the ports of San Francisco. ""

A well dressed man, clad in green military garb and sunglasses stepped onto the dusty podium in the center of Pheonix, crowds gathered around as the man seemed as though he knew what was happening in San Fransisco. "Dear people of the great state of Arizona, we are addressing you as proud citizens who will not tolerate what a foreign power imposes on them, and that is occupation. An incompetent government brought occupation to American soil for the first time after 200 years of our independence and invincibility! To ensure what God and the nation have given us, we must do what is hardest in our hearts, we will have to tear our state, even more, to save it because it is better to die poor and hungry than under the steel boots of a communist dictator! I am now speaking to you as a representative of the nation, as one of you, ready to fight for the independence of the Arizona Culture, to do my best, to do what is left of us after the great destruction of American society. I stand proudly before you, claiming that this is a struggle between freedom and slavery, between life and death, between our nation and the foreign occupier! We stand here united around the idea of ​​saying the following words in their faces: We will never obey your aspirations! We die and fall together, NEVER! WE DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR BOOT CLEANING WAX!” Some cheered, some cried at the announcement, most watched silently, as another power-crazed man made promises to people living in the middle of a desert, unsure if he would actually do anything for Arizona."

He had no idea as to why his father had called him to his office, but he was almost certain he wasn't going to like it. His arms began to itch. Before long, it felt like a swarm of fireants had taken over his body. But in the room full of military men and seasoned beaurocrats, he didn't dare give off just how badly his addiction was afflicting him. Nobody could know, least of all his father. So he just wiped the sweat from his forehead a second time.\n\nThe door opened. 'Come in, son.'. Whatever he was about to be told, he hoped it could be short so he could remedy his withdrawal symptoms.\n\n"Now, son, you know I love ya, and you know I've let you off from a lot, which is why I now think it's time you pay me back.". God, what does the old man want now? Some publicity trip? A speech? Looks like I was worried about nothing. "Northam's a great governor, but the Civil War has taken its toll on him. I'm not sure how long he's going to hold out. So I see an opportunity here. The Soul of America rests on me- and as my son, it rests on you. So I'm sending you to Virginia.". What?!

 #Florida
 florida.1.t:0 "The Funeral of Eric Trump"
 florida.1.d:0 "The room fell into silence as the priest slowly stepped up near the coffin, glancing at it, then at Jeb Bush, then at Barron, sorrow in his eyes. “We are here to mourn the death of Eric Trump, a man whose life was stolen from us too soon, and may those who brought his death upon him face God’s wrath for their sins,” the priest began, before talking about how Eric stood as an icon for the people of Florida and their hopes and dreams, and how they should go on and not tarnish his memory.\n\nBarron began thinking back to the moment his brother’s life was taken from him, remembering the sudden chaos as the figure burst into the room, levelling a handgun at Eric. Before anyone could even comprehend what was happening, the shots, oh God the shots rang out and in that moment Eric became no more than an empty body.\n\n“Now, Barron Trump,” the priest said, jolting him out of his bleak memories into an only slightly less bleak moment. “Do you want to say anything about your brother?” He gestured for him to come up to the platform where the priest and the coffin were.\n\nBarron nodded, coming up the steps and trying not to stare at the well-crafted coffin, the best that money could buy. If only there was a way to buy Eric’s return. He turned to face the crowd, his face morose and still. His eyes caught on Jeb, who was murmuring quietly to a few other men next to him in the crowd, pausing slightly as he noticed Barron’s gaze, before continuing the conversation, too quiet for him to make out what they were saying.\n\n“My brother may not have been perfect,” he started his speech, his mind immediately coming up with several mistakes he had made as he led Florida. “But he did the best he could, especially in the chaotic times we live in. I’m sure nobody here is glad he is gone-” Did he hear a snicker? Or was he just being paranoid? “But we cannot change what happened to him. We can only carry on and hope we can do what is best for us and all of our people.” He bowed his head to look at his black, polished shoes, making sure to squash his emotions. How could he seem like a capable leader if he started bawling his eyes out?\n\nA few claps came from assorted people in the crowd, quiet to try and not disturb the mood of the occasion as Barron moved down from the platform where his brother lay, glad to have that over with. He had a lot to do, and he didn’t know how much longer he had to do it all."

You think we have enough time to train all our soldiers up as good as you want them? I know you want to believe in our troop's willpower, but for God's sake they'll get slaughtered even more than they would in a World War 1 battle!"\n\n"So just shoving guns into civilian's hands right after you draft them? Yeah that'll work," Rafael scoffed, turning his back on his fellow general.\n\n"Our people have been hardened by these conflicts, don't be so disheartened by the thought. And they are getting training, I'm not saying give them a gun and shove them to the front lines!" Julio thundered.\n\n"Our logistics can't handle that amount of troops easily!"\n\n"Our troops aren't well trained enough and have good enough guns to fight the enemy off without that amount of troops!"\n\nThe two glared at each other acrossed the room, then slowly turned their gaze to Barron, begging for arbritration."

He felt a slight pang of disappointment to hear the officer corps had defected as well, but he had planned for this very occasion. He knew the soldiers were loyal to him, and he had competent allies.\n\n"Do not worry so much, Nicholas." Barron kept his emotionless gaze as he looked up at his closest ally. "This has shown for all to see who the true Floridians are, and who the wretched traitors are. Jebediah will be dealt with." Nick nodded in understanding. "Now, Nicholas, since we are now lacking in high command, I think it's time for some people to receive some promotions...""

 florida.13.d:0 "Corporal Rico snuffed out his cigarette on the floor as he saw a superior officer approaching. He didn't get along terribly well with the officers, nobody did. Bastard careerists had become greedy and politicised in the wake of the civil war. None of them cared about Florida, none of them cared about America. They just sat here, in Miami, filling their pockets and speaking out against their supposed Commander-In-Chief.\n\nThis was the worst post of them all. Instead of doing any good, fighting Confederates or Commies, he was making sure these officers didn't get some rocks thrown at them by frustrated schoolchildren. Well, at least Barron was making moves against them. That was something at least. Rico thought about his disappointment in Jeb, however. He couldn't believe he voted for that worm into the governorship all those years ago. Although these days, voting seemed like a distant memory.\n\nThe Officer finally reached Rico, and interrupted his thoughts. "You there, Corporal. Where do your loyalties lie in this civil war?" Rico snorted. He hated these types of people. His loyalty is being questioned, undoubtedly by a man whose loyalties were to the rebellious Governor and not to the rightful Leader. He'd show him.\n\n"Barron Trump, of course... Sir." The Officer looked disappointed in him. Good. Showed that bastard that not everyone supports rich idiots in glass castles. What was he gonna do about it? Report me?\n\n"Very Well." The officer said to Rico's surprise. And before Rico could react, the Officer raised his M1911 to his head."

 florida.14.t:0 "NO! NOT YOU AGAIN!"
 florida.14.d:0 "In the greatest solitude in the darkness of the Miami prison, lying on the ground, visibly beaten and mistreated, he could not move. He could not open his eyes nor could he think normally from the torture he suffered. Every step would upset him to flinch in fear thinking that Judgment Day had come for him. Spreading through the cells, the sound of the creaking of a metal door woke him from the sleep he so desperately wanted to get. Hitting the wall and the bars with his fingers, Jeb knew who was coming to visit him again. He turned to his side to see what he had to see every third day of the week. Barron ran his hand over the fence that separated him from Jeb, who said with suffering in his voice, "Not you ... not you again, you motherfucker ..."\n\n"Open the door." Barron told the guard, who turned the keys in search of the right one. After the door is opened, Jeb tried to escape towards the wall, visibly frightened and distraught by Barron's appearance. "Get on your feet, you useless bag of fleas!" He yelled at him, kicking him in the stomach and grabbing him by the collar. Jeb only succumbed to this silence and did not intend, nor did he have the strength to get up. Knowing that Jeb would not get up, he pulled him towards him and threw him to the ground, now even harder than he had kicked him the first time. "I don't have time to lose, get up!" He yelled at him until Jeb intended to give up his helpless lying on the cold concrete as Barron screamed his name, demanding he not be a poor coward. "If you could get away with it and declare war, take this as a continuation of the war!" He yelled again, kicking him directly in the spine, while Jeb moaned with all his might, begging for mercy. "There is no mercy for the traitors of the regime!" He continued, not giving in. Jeb tried to lift himself against the wall with his hand, but Barron prevented him from doing so by stepping on his hand with a heavy military boot, breaking his bones into small pieces. Jeb no longer had the strength, he had to surrender, and this was no longer interesting to Barron either, and he realized that his torture would lose its sharpness if he continued. Approaching him in a light, quiet, threatening tone, he told him: "Now you won't be able to clap, Bush's shit ...""

They never did when these kinds of things happened, which were becoming increasingly common.\n\nThe woman’s son cried out, but finally someone reacted and ran out to the child, putting a hand over the child’s mouth to muffle his cries. “It’s gonna be okay,” the person murmured, trying to quiet the child so he didn’t agitate the police more. “Do you know where your father is?” he asked.\n\nThe kid shook his head slightly, started to choke down his tears so he wouldn’t make as much noise. “Got… giraffed into da war,” he said quietly, still reaching out to his mother and trying to go towards her as she was roughly dragged into the armored truck, before driving off. The child broke down again, and the stranger who tried to stop him from crying before finally let him. The police were gone now, so it was safe. But who would take care of this child?"

For it is necessary that we have a strong leader during these troubling times.  There are very clearly enemies all around us and he has done the best to make sure we Patriots are able to serve his will.” \n\nFuentes paused, waiting for a reaction from the crowd, an eerie silence fell over it before the noise of clapping broke it.  More and more people started clapping until loud roars took over the crowd.\n\nHe continued,\n\n“We Patriots will be the ones that secure America and provide a safe haven for the next generation.  It will be us that guide Americans to their inevitable reclamation of their homeland.  Now, it is necessary that we pick a strong leader - a leader who won't cuck to Conservative Inc or the GOP - and that man is Barron Trump!

Apart from not doing anything, he kept a pile of papers next to him, but they were not particularly important to him, so he put them aside so that he could later take care of what was written in them. Standing in front of the door, Patrick knocked for Barron to look up at the door. "It's free." He said briefly, continuing to do what he did not do.\n\n"I came as fast as I could. I was told you were waiting for me in the office."\n\n"That's right. Sit down." He continued in his standard monotonous tone, answering briefly and without the need for details in his words. Waiting for him to settle comfortably in his chair, he pushed the papers aside to join hands, making a pyramid of fingers, and looked Patrick directly in the eye. "I like your ideas and I think they could help me a lot in my plan." Barron began the conversation as Patrick watched him with mixed feelings of fear and ridicule.\n\n"Go on, I'm listening." Patrick said.\n\n"I would like to have your determination and strength in government. I think it is crucial to our goals in Florida."\n\n"How would I be involved in government if I were to know?"\n\n"You would run a propaganda department as well as a death penalty department while your people could be absorbed into our ranks so they could influence the development and provision of our idea."\n\n"Okay, I think I like this idea."\n\n"Would that mean I have your support?"\n\n"Of course." Giving him a document that should make this decision official, Patrick signed it without discussion, without looking at what is actually written in the document.\n\n"I'm glad you're reasonable."

Reputation and the army, although the army was his larger share than his honor. Now he didn't have that either. It seemed as if the fight was in vain, and that he was bamboozled.

In some miserable T-shirt purely for the sake of order, he was dragged like a dog and thrown to the ground while Barron shouted at him knowing that this would be the last time he would spend with Jeb. Grasping his shoulder and lifting him off the ground, he pushed him forward, bringing him back into balance. "Walk you pig." He told him briefly, ignoring the surroundings. Donald was waiting for them in the main room, which was right at the entrance to the building. "I brought you something as a present." Barron said from the doorway as Donald looked back in his direction. "I think you'll like this toy more than I liked it." He added to the previous sentence as Donald made a satisfied, albeit also somewhat disturbed, expression on his face and extended his hand to him, congratulating him on this one.\n\n"You're telling the truth, this is going to be the perfect trophy for my conquests." Donald said, looking at Jeb as some kind of commodity, a slither of pity slipping through his iron gaze before remembering all that Jeb had done to try and overthrow him. "I like it. Does it know how to do something special or did it serve as an ornament for you?"\n\n"Punching bag."\n\n"Terrific. I was just thinking about losing weight."\n\n"I have to go.

Barron noticed this, but didn't feel the need to point it out.\n\n"Your job is not complex. Your job is simple- propaganda. Your job is to make us have a 'good' voice and to make sure that the unpopularity of other people is maintained at the current, even lower level. Understand?" Barron tried to be what he had always been, quiet and withdrawn, cold but active.\n\nSam was looking at him and thinking, "Woah, I am Barron's top man. I am Barron's top man. This doesn't happen every day." Turning in the opposite direction. "I could be Barron's guy for stuff ... yes, that would be really something. Being his man. Top man. I'm just going to have to work hard for this." He continued to talk to himself as he walked down the hall. "Washington is for pussies. I'm gonna be like Stonewall Jackson.

"The best example of this was Thomas Jefferson. He did not want to use his position to remove the idea of ​​slavery, although he had the possibilities and space for such maneuvering, but his basic idea, which he implemented in 1802 with the White Act, remained hidden behind the scenes. neoliberal American policy which made it clear that slavery was universal in the sense that it represented more white people as slaves than blacks, leading us to the new conclusion that the post-Washington administration had a very clear intention to subjugate not only blacks but all races, which is one of the provisions of the White Act of 1802 that we have already mentioned. Slavery is not determined by race. Slavery is determined by human decisions that lead to bad or criminal acts. " These were the last words of the teacher who closed the book while showing a copy of the ‘White Act of 1802’ signed by Thomas Jefferson.

It arrived at lunchtime and today on offer was moldy bread with one small glass of water from a local swamp they were pumping so that the water could go to unspoiled citizens in Miami and larger cities like Savannah.

He knows what it's like to walk on the streets unprotected and be stalked by a traitor who points a gun in his direction and a cold knife blade at his neck! He managed to ensure you had enough food! He provided you with enough water to survive! For God's sake, If Biden didn't usurp the voting in 2020 everything would be fine now.

Kennedy, was hiding behind a cabinet, hoping to hold off the monarchist forces for long enough so his wife and child could escape to Bidenist forces. \n\nAs the sun set, he heard the roar of mechanized infantry, a door being ripped off of its hinges, then the scream of his neighbor. Two gunshots rang out in the night, which were then followed by a barrage of gunfire in response. Suddenly, the door is ripped off of its hinges as 5 soldiers bust into the Kennedy household... 4 shots were heard, and then silence...

Ten minutes after he had been told to wait, Cruz's secretary came out of the office and approached George. "Mr. Bush, President Cruz said you could come in." "Thank goodness he decided to receive me." George said, and went inside while Cruz was writing something down. He was a bit annoyed that he wasn't being referred to as 'president', as he should be, but he wasn't exactly in a position to demand formalities.\n\n"Sit down, George, tell me why you came to me?" It was his words, taking his eyes off what he had been doing so far and looking directly at George.\n\n"He needs your help, Cruz. That silver-spoon fed son of even the bastard that started all this can fall Cruz if you decide to follow my advice. Jeb led an armed rebellion against him, but he possibly win on his own." George W. Bush's words were panicked as Cruz continued to look at him with the same gaze.\n\n"I'll tell you honestly, George, I don't have the time, nerve or resources to deal with your retarded brother's problem. I'm sorry to tell you this, but if your brother fucks himself over, that's his own fault."\n\n"So that's it? You fucking yellow-bellied coward. Remember this - if you ever need my support, don't even think about contacting me."\n\n"America never needed Jeb. So I doubt very much that I will need you."\n\n"Fuck you."

All his words are false - we all know that for a long time. Do you remember what he told you earlier? When he told you that only his ideas are good and ideas that came from someone else aren't?

Ted Cruz is striving to establish communism in Texas, whose environment we love as it is and do not want to change it for the sake of some useless ideals that will sooner or later destroy everything we have fought for since our independence.He refuses to launch or support a campaign against that bastardic son who came from that idiot Trump which destroyed us together with Cruz's communist friend Biden. Please, as people and residents of Texas, as people who want to live freely in the state in which they were born - do not reach for the communist dystopia offered by Ted Cruz, but follow me - for a person who will respect your decisions. whatever they were.

Both Biden and Trump count on our cooperation. \n\nThe first step of our "new government" should be to determine whether or not we are to continue to be bound by the old constitution - by calling new elections, following Biden or Trump.

These authorities wish to cooperate in return for an offer to protect our state from the sanderists, and to preserve our autonomy by partially taking power over our military staff. In practice, this means that they would like to take over our rebellion using its opportunity to expand - not to help us. \n\nGiving them control over our army will de facto lead to our annexation, and it seems they are military preparing for us to decline the offerm just to seize us, by force."

Mullet was suggested to replace him as the New Montana glorious leader. Since both leaders appear to be supermatist authorities, we should make a choice.

 montana.29.t:0 "Montana Joins Trump's Loyalists"
 montana.29.d:0 "Some, wondering about the future of an independent Montana, were unsure of its direction. Ultimately, it turned out that the game to achieve independence was more of an attempt to disguise his allegiance to Trump's forces. Following today's secret leadership meeting, an alliance was formally forged to include Montana in the ever-expanding Loyalists' front. \n\n Trump sees this as a great step towards the unification of America's interests, while [MON.GetLeader] sees it as a great opportunity for expansion and ''restoration'' of the Northwest Territorial Imperative."

Guided by Ted's ideas that the industrial revolution was a mistake and one of the main factors in the decline of civilization, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman formed a de facto government that would have the characteristics of basic anarcho-primitivists, such as Kazcynski himself. This combination of militaristic drug gangsterism and the primitiveness of ideology was a shock to all participants in the American Civil War, and the emerging factions continue to amaze us.

The meeting that handed him actual power had been a baffling one, if any words were to describe it. 'Here you go, Mr. Baugh. You're in charge now. Real power,' said the council, and, quite frankly, he thought it a joke as well. But then war started happening. News from the East and West of domestic terrorism and American fighting American. And then people started pouring in. Maybe it was the wikipedia articles, maybe it was the silly film he had taken part in, but people wanted refuge, and what could Kevin Baugh do but oblige? More people showed up. Some with tents, some with only the clothes on their backs, and some with even less. Defectors from the world over, not Republican, not Democrat, but American. Baugh welcomed them with blankets and open arms. His Vice President and wife had been a godsend in this time as well, for every person that came in she came in, asking names, if they needed help, or even just a phone call. Most were happy to find peace, maybe for a few days, maybe a month, even. But as the tensions rose, more people found themselves staying. Kevin Baugh found himself with real legitimacy, and when he had asked for more land, more help, the neighboring cities, floundering in their own right, joined in. They turned a ghost town into a real settlement, and A town of four hundred into four thousand. Change was coming to the Republic of Molossia. Baugh only hoped he could meet it with a steady hand."

Baugh closed his eyes and took a look at his hand. \n\nTwo-Seven, both of a different suit. It was nothing. The General grinned, too. He waited for the three cards to be put up, maybe he had a chance if they were just- \n\nAn ace, a king, and a nine. The General grinned wider.

The one with the A in the corner. He was expressionless, though. That rule he knew. She put another card on the table. A two. Walker didn't know what to make of that, but she put down the final card, another ace, and the General revealed his hand.

Ideas ran through his head. He considered just leaving the system in place, just to see what would happen. But this wasn't a nation of test subjects, it was a nation of people, and something needed to be done. His eyes settled on a map on his wall, listing out the nearby settlements.

It had been a grueling event, to have his nation torn apart by whatever advisor he could find walking among the tents of the various new settlements popping up left and right, the only promise of payment being a warm meal and extra blankets, and he had had his legal code torn to shreds, but at least he knew what to do." #placeholder

He was listening to the radio when he saw the dust on the horizon. At first, he thought it was a dust storm. They were apparently usual for the area, after all, but it was getting closer fast. It looked like a trio of mustangs, colored red, white, and blue. They seem to have spotted Charlie first, and were approaching quickly. They came skidding to a stop, blocking the road completely. Charlie brought their wagon to a halt as well. One of the folk came out of the passenger side and approached Charlie's window. She made a motion to roll it down. \n\n'Listen here sweetheart,' she said after Charlie complied, 'Here's what's gonna happen.
