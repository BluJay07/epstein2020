 #Great Lakes
 greatlake.1.t:0 "Challenges to the Jorgenson Government"
 greatlake.1.d:0 "Taking advantage of the temporary peace, many figures from across the Libertarian spectrum have travelled to the Great Lakes to directly challenge Jorgenson's leadership.\n\nNot exactly being prepared for a civil war herself when she took leadership of the Libertarian party, she's herself is open to resignation.\n\nThe main two candidates are Clint Eastwood, who wants to align far more closely with Donald Trump and implement policy akin to Reaganism, and the other is John McAfee who wants to establish what is effectively an Anarcho-Capitalist society with security forces exclusively for the purpose of protecting the region from invasion."
 greatlake.1.a:0 "Actually, I think I'll stick around..."
 greatlake.1.b:0 "Up the Yellow and Black!"
 greatlake.1.c:0 "For a fistfull of dollars..."
 greatlake.2.t:0 "The Great Lakes draws closer"
 greatlake.2.d:0 "Following our failure to secure much of Wisconsin and Michigan, and the seizure of those territories by the Libertarians, the Republican friendly Clint Eastwood has recently come to lead those territories. Incredibly Trump aligned, Clint is offering to fully pledge the Great Lakes behind the Trumpist cause in exchange for autonomy, at least for the duration of the Civil War."
 greatlake.2.a:0 "I loved his films!"
 greatlake.2.b:0 "We don't need some Reagan copy-cat."
 #Cascadia
 cascadia.1.t:0 "Coup!"
 cascadia.1.d:0 "The Worst has happened! Our former allies in New Awakening have infiltrated the Resistance Council far more than ever could have been expected, and they have now launched a coup to oust all non-aligned members of the council!\n\nWe had not expected this level of cohesion."
 cascadia.1.a:0 "We are powerless to stop them."
 cascadia.1.b:0 "Rally the resistance! We have a new foe!"
 #Tribal
 tribal.1.t:0 "Neo-Nazi gangs set off from Denver"
 tribal.1.d:0 "Many neo-nazi militias which had met in Denver, rallied by James Mason, set off to the South. We have no real idea what they're up to... but so far they've left us alone, and we have much bigger things to worry about."
 tribal.1.a:0 "I'm sure it'll be fine... what's the worst they could do?"
 tribal.2.t:0 "Invasion!"
 tribal.2.d:0 "It all began with rumors of Americans on the horizon. Some braves souls left their camps to meet them, seeking to redirect them, as they'd thought them to be lost refugees. They were mistaken. The Americans brandished flags branded with swastikas and donned the garb of guerilla fighters. Countless villages by the border have been brutalized and massacred, and it seems nothing truly halts them from marching on our capital."
 tribal.2.a:0 "The end of our dream."
 tribal.3.t:0 "The Death of James Mason"
 tribal.3.d:0 "The Great Fuhrer is dead! He has led us through many trials and tribulations, and has been a loyal National Socialist since he was but a child. We will never forget our first Fuhrer, and he will be remembered forever as the man who saved the world. However, his protege, Augustus Sol Invictus, now seizes the reins with little to no opposition. And his plans are far grander."
 tribal.3.a:0 "HAIL CAESAR!"
 tribal.4.t:0 "Foreign Volunteers Arrive"
 tribal.4.d:0 "350 men from Europe, most notable among them British Nationalist Mark Collett, have arrived in our territory seeking to join our ranks.\n\nNaturally as Evropan White Men, they are more than suitable to join our cause, and we will integrate them into our ranks immediately."
 tribal.4.a:0 "But... 350? Is that it?"
 #Virginia
 virginia.1.t:0 "Like Father, Like Son"
 virginia.1.d:0 "Hunter wiped the sweat from his brow as he sat in the waiting room. He had no idea as to why his father had called him to his office, but he was almost certain he wasn't going to like it. His arms began to itch. Before long, it felt like a swarm of fireants had taken over his body. But in the room full of military men and seasoned beaurocrats, he didn't dare give off just how badly his addiction was afflicting him. Nobody could know, least of all his father. So he just wiped the sweat from his forehead a second time.\n\nThe door opened. 'Come in, son.'. Whatever he was about to be told, he hoped it could be short so he could remedy his withdrawal symptoms.\n\n"Now, son, you know I love ya, and you know I've let you off from a lot, which is why I now think it's time you pay me back.". God, what does the old man want now? Some publicity trip? A speech? Looks like I was worried about nothing. "Northam's a great governor, but the Civil War has taken its toll on him. I'm not sure how long he's going to hold out. So I see an opportunity here. The Soul of America rests on me- and as my son, it rests on you. So I'm sending you to Virginia.". What?! Has he finally lost it? Why the fuck would he put me in charge of that frontline rural shithole?\n"Dad--"\n"Now I won't hear any objections from you, sonny, this will be a great experience for you, experience I think you'll find you'll need in the near future. Kiddo...""
 virginia.1.a:0 "...You'll be a leader, or you won't be at all!"
 #Florida
 florida.1.t:0 "The Funeral of Eric Trump"
 florida.1.d:0 "The room fell into silence as the priest slowly stepped up near the coffin, glancing at it, then at Jeb Bush, then at Barron, sorrow in his eyes. “We are here to mourn the death of Eric Trump, a man whose life was stolen from us too soon, and may those who brought his death upon him face God’s wrath for their sins,” the priest began, before talking about how Eric stood as an icon for the people of Florida and their hopes and dreams, and how they should go on and not tarnish his memory.\n\nBarron began thinking back to the moment his brother’s life was taken from him, remembering the sudden chaos as the figure burst into the room, levelling a handgun at Eric. Before anyone could even comprehend what was happening, the shots, oh God the shots rang out and in that moment Eric became no more than an empty body.\n\n“Now, Barron Trump,” the priest said, jolting him out of his bleak memories into an only slightly less bleak moment. “Do you want to say anything about your brother?” He gestured for him to come up to the platform where the priest and the coffin were.\n\nBarron nodded, coming up the steps and trying not to stare at the well-crafted coffin, the best that money could buy. If only there was a way to buy Eric’s return. He turned to face the crowd, his face morose and still. His eyes caught on Jeb, who was murmuring quietly to a few other men next to him in the crowd, pausing slightly as he noticed Barron’s gaze, before continuing the conversation, too quiet for him to make out what they were saying.\n\n“My brother may not have been perfect,” he started his speech, his mind immediately coming up with several mistakes he had made as he led Florida. “But he did the best he could, especially in the chaotic times we live in. I’m sure nobody here is glad he is gone-” Did he hear a snicker? Or was he just being paranoid? “But we cannot change what happened to him. We can only carry on and hope we can do what is best for us and all of our people.” He bowed his head to look at his black, polished shoes, making sure to squash his emotions. How could he seem like a capable leader if he started bawling his eyes out?\n\nA few claps came from assorted people in the crowd, quiet to try and not disturb the mood of the occasion as Barron moved down from the platform where his brother lay, glad to have that over with. He had a lot to do, and he didn’t know how much longer he had to do it all."
 florida.1.a:0 "Only the dead can truly rest"
 florida.2.t:0 "The Doctrine Dispute"
 florida.2.d:0 ""We don't have the manpower to go toe-to-toe with them and have as numerical superiority as you want! You'll just get thousands needlessly slaughtered!" Rafael Ribas exclaimed loudly in the office.\n\nJulio Acosta slammed a hand down on the desk. "Well we need to at least have enough men! You think we have enough time to train all our soldiers up as good as you want them? I know you want to believe in our troop's willpower, but for God's sake they'll get slaughtered even more than they would in a World War 1 battle!"\n\n"So just shoving guns into civilian's hands right after you draft them? Yeah that'll work," Rafael scoffed, turning his back on his fellow general.\n\n"Our people have been hardened by these conflicts, don't be so disheartened by the thought. And they are getting training, I'm not saying give them a gun and shove them to the front lines!" Julio thundered.\n\n"Our logistics can't handle that amount of troops easily!"\n\n"Our troops aren't well trained enough and have good enough guns to fight the enemy off without that amount of troops!"\n\nThe two glared at each other acrossed the room, then slowly turned their gaze to Barron, begging for arbritration."
 florida.2.a:0 "Ribas makes a good point"
 florida.2.b:0 "Acosta's theories make most sense"
 florida.3.t:0 "Victory in the Panhandle!"
 florida.3.d:0 "Our forces have successfully raided the vile Confederacy, and they return home with plunder and slaves."
 florida.3.a:0 "No one man should have this much power"
 florida.4.t:0 "Defeat in the Panhandle!"
 florida.4.d:0 "The Confederate Army effectively repulsed our forces in the Panhandle. We learnt valuable lessons from this, but this has damaged our reputation greatly."
 florida.4.a:0 "Blast!"
 florida.5.t:0 "The Floridian Raid has been Smashed!"
 florida.5.d:0 "Reports have come in of Floridian soldiers crossing into the Panhandle in attempt to raid us for supply and slaves. Thankfully, our ever vigilant forces were there to push them back over the border!"
 florida.5.a:0 "Stay in your swamp, Floridian scum!"
 florida.6.t:0 "Battle of the Panhandle"
 florida.6.d:0 "Following escalating tensions between the Confederacy and the State of Florida, troops have crossed the border and began raiding settlements in search for loot and possible slaves. Our militiamen were mobilised to combat them, but they were far more organised than us and had effectively battleplanned the whole operation. All our local commanders could do is watch as the Floridians escaped back to their side of the border."
 florida.6.a:0 "We must strengthen our hold of the border."
 florida.7.t:0 "Florida proposes a ceasefire"
 florida.7.d:0 "Florida has come to us today proposing a cessation of hostilities between themselves and our Confederacy, allowing both troops to traverse in each others' borders unhampered. This signifies a new age of Detente between our nations, and there is little reason not to accept."
 florida.7.a:0 "As you said, there's no reason not to!"
 florida.7.b:0 "They're up to something. Reject the offer."
 florida.8.t:0 "The Confederacy Accepts!"
 florida.8.d:0 "The Confederates have accepted our offer. Our troops will no longer fire on each other on sight, and we can traverse their lands unimpeded."
 florida.8.a:0 "The beginning of a beautiful friendship, no doubt."
 florida.9.t:0 "The Confederacy Rejects our Offer!"
 florida.9.d:0 "The Confederates have rejected our offer! This is a significant roadblock in our quest for peace."
 florida.9.a:0 "They're more crazy than I!"
 florida.10.t:0 "The Panhandle Treaty"
 florida.10.d:0 "The Floridians have come to us today requesting the return of their original state lines in the Panhandle. Naturally this would be expected, but they're actually offering significant payment for the territory."
 florida.10.a:0 "With money like this... who needs some redneck backwater?"
 florida.10.b:0 "It would give them too much of a strategic advantage."
 florida.11.t:0 "Talks have Broken Down"
 florida.11.d:0 "While Confederate officials were initially in favour of selling us back the Panhandle, Kanye West himself personally intervened in the negotiations and rejected all our offers. Since what we came here for was now off the table, our delegation promptly left."
 florida.11.a:0 "How embarrassing..."
 florida.12.t:0 "Jebediah's Betrayal"
 florida.12.d:0 ""I cannot believe that fucking cuck actually went ahead with it," Nicholas burst into Barron's office, a clear look of rage and fury upon his face. "Have you heard, sir? All our fucking officers have gone South to Miami, the cowards, and Jeb is now openly speaking against us, that fucking cuck!" Barron was surprised only that it had happened this soon. He felt a slight pang of disappointment to hear the officer corps had defected as well, but he had planned for this very occasion. He knew the soldiers were loyal to him, and he had competent allies.\n\n"Do not worry so much, Nicholas." Barron kept his emotionless gaze as he looked up at his closest ally. "This has shown for all to see who the true Floridians are, and who the wretched traitors are. Jebediah will be dealt with." Nick nodded in understanding. "Now, Nicholas, since we are now lacking in high command, I think it's time for some people to receive some promotions...""
 florida.12.a:0 "And I think you'll make for an excellent commander."
 florida.13.t:0 "Midnight in Miami"
 florida.13.d:0 "Corporal Rico snuffed out his cigarette on the floor as he saw a superior officer approaching. He didn't get along terribly well with the officers, nobody did. Bastard careerists had become greedy and politicised in the wake of the civil war. None of them cared about Florida, none of them cared about America. They just sat here, in Miami, filling their pockets and speaking out against their supposed Commander-In-Chief.\n\nThis was the worst post of them all. Instead of doing any good, fighting Confederates or Commies, he was making sure these officers didn't get some rocks thrown at them by frustrated schoolchildren. Well, at least Barron was making moves against them. That was something at least. Rico thought about his disappointment in Jeb, however. He couldn't believe he voted for that worm into the governorship all those years ago. Although these days, voting seemed like a distant memory.\n\nThe Officer finally reached Rico, and interrupted his thoughts. "You there, Corporal. Where do your loyalties lie in this civil war?" Rico snorted. He hated these types of people. His loyalty is being questioned, undoubtedly by a man whose loyalties were to the rebellious Governor and not to the rightful Leader. He'd show him.\n\n"Barron Trump, of course... Sir." The Officer looked disappointed in him. Good. Showed that bastard that not everyone supports rich idiots in glass castles. What was he gonna do about it? Report me?\n\n"Very Well." The officer said to Rico's surprise. And before Rico could react, the Officer raised his M1911 to his head."
 florida.13.a:0 "And Corporal Rico was no more."
